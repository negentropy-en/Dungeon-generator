# Specification Document

This specification document defines the assignment to be completed in the University of Helsinki's Subject Studies Assignment: Algorithms and AI Project.

I am taking this course in the Bachelor's in Computer Science (TKT) program.

## Subject and implementation

In my project, I am implementing a procedural dungeon generator that creates randomized maps through a staged algorithmic pipeline. The core algorithm is Delaunay triangulation (via the Bowyer-Watson method), which establishes a robust spatial relationships between rooms before corridors are created. 

The dungeon generation process proceeds in multiple phases. . . to be continued when the project starts to shape out.

Bowyer-Watson implementation behaves approximately in O(n^2) for n rooms. Kruskal's algorithm runs in O(n log n) over triangulation edges. 

## Programming languages

This project will be done in Python. 
Peer review can be done in Python, Java, or C. 

## Project language

Project language is English. Code, variable names as well as other comments will also be in English.
