# Weekly Report 6

**Week period:41st**  
**Time spent (hours):10**  

## What did I do this week?
- Wrote tests and implemented new features; haven't yet pushed them into the repo since they need a bit more work. Worked also on the user guide with the new features.

## How did the program progress?
- Project is in a good state, works as intended, but still needs a few finishing touches on tests and handling the randomization of generated rooms as well as adding the new features.

## What did I learn?
- Comprehensive testing and other suitable testing techniques.

## What was unclear or difficult?
- No real issues other than randomization of generated rooms; large amount of generated rooms.

## What will I do next?
- Finish on writing the documentations for user guides and others, as well as push made changes into the repo before the second peer review. Also, start preparing for the demo session.
