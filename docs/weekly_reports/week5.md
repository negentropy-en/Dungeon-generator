# Weekly Report 5

**Week period:40th**  
**Time spent (hours):16**  

## What did I do this week?
- Read the peer review that I got on my project and reflected on it/thought about what the project was "missing" in a sense, and how could I implement such features to the project. Wrote some tests, but haven't yet pushed them into the repo due to new features that are possibly going to get added.

## How did the program progress?
- Started working on limiting the amount of rooms that is created by setting the number of rooms that is randomized to a range of 3-100; not yet implemented. Also, started writing some tests, and while most of them are working, I'm still trying to implement other changes to the project as well that I got suggested in the peer review such as: regenerating new rooms by pressing R in the --game mode, quitting by pressing Q, and other visual aspects like MST paths visibility.

## What did I learn?
- Learned how others have built their own projects and what kind of aspects they prioritized. It was interesting to see also how they chose similar approaches as me, but took some other creative paths to show how their implementation worked. 

## What was unclear or difficult?
- Not particularly difficult, but challenging to implement all the features that I got suggested in the given timeframe.

## What will I do next?
- Write more tests and focus on implementing suggested features to the project, since I feel that they will enhance the overall user experience; no need to start the viewer over again to generate new rooms for example.
