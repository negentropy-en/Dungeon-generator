# Weekly Report 2

**Week period:37th**  
**Time spent (hours):15**  

## What did I do this week?
- Started coding a little bit, and mapping out the scope of the project itself. 

## How did the program progress?
- Managed to code a little bit on the Delaunay's algorithm part and dungeon itself.

## What did I learn?
- I learned about Delaunay's triangulation a bit more and how to implement A* algorithm for corridors.

## What was unclear or difficult?
- Bowyer-Watson algorithm is still a bit hard to implement into my code. Trying to get it to working in the upcoming weeks.

## What will I do next?
- Working on Bowyer-Watson algorithm and other implementations in the project. Also, search more information about said algorithm and other possible configurations for visualization as well as pathfinding if there's time for it.
