# Weekly Report 4

**Week period:39th**  
**Time spent (hours):15**  

## What did I do this week?
- Worked again on the same dungeon creation part as well as other parts in it such as grid creations, corridors, and edges; same as previous week but rewrote some functions. Did more work on how super triangles are identified and "bad" triangles removed.

## How did the program progress?
- Made more progress on grid generation, room connectivity and MST/Delaunay triangulation.  

## What did I learn?
- Super triangles; large initial triangle that is used in the Bowyer-Watson algorithm to create Delaunay triangulation. Creating new triangles by connecting the new point to the edges of the cavity.

## What was unclear or difficult?
- Marking which rooms had been visited and which of the rooms as well as corridors are "walkable" and connected. Needed to a bit more research on Delaunay's algorithm and MST. Learned about super-triangle and implementing that was also a bit blurry.  

## What will I do next?
- Mostly check what the peer review says about the project as a whole and reflect on it afterwards. Need to work on tests and other documentation such as user guide for example, so that others can run the project properly without too much file editing.
