# Weekly Report 3

**Week period:38th**  
**Time spent (hours):8**  

## What did I do this week?
- Worked on dungeon creation as well as other parts in it such as grid creations, corridors, and edges.

## How did the program progress?
- Coded some parts on dungeon creation as well as other parts in it; grid creations, corridors, and edges. Started working on pathfinding, game interface and visualization a bit by doing literature reviews on it and searching information in general about it. 

## What did I learn?
- Learned how grids, edges, and corridors form. Also, what would happen if different corridors intersect rooms; nothing good.  

## What was unclear or difficult?
- Time management, since I started doing literature reviews on my thesis, and that took majority of my time as well as other parts in it, such as essay writing and work plan configuration.

## What will I do next?
- Trying to get every part working and running. Possibly trying to fix any problems that might arise during it. Checking out matplotlib renderer and pygame viewer also. Project still needs a lot of work to get every part working correctly.
