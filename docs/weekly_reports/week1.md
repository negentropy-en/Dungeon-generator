# Weekly Report 1

**Week period:**  
**Time spent (hours):**  

## What did I do this week?
- This week I started planning the selected subject and what the restraints as well as the limitations would be with it. Most of the time was spent on researching Delaunay's algorithm, reading course material, searching other suitable algorithms and literature. Also, started configuring about the project management tools, mainly Poetry, regarding the test coverage dependencies. 

## How did the program progress?
- I didn't start coding on the first week, since most of the time was spent on research, studying the course material and learning about the algorithms.

## What did I learn?
- I learned about the mathematics behind Delaunay triangulation and approaches for procedural room generation in general. In addition, some initial structure for the project itself. 

## What was unclear or difficult?
- At first it was hard to determine what data structures to use for the triangulation, if I should implement connection points for different rooms, and if I should allow overlapping of rooms. I'm sure this will clear out in the upcoming weeks, after I start coding so that I know what is doable in the given timeframe.

## What will I do next?
- Search for existing libraries regarding possible algorithms, so that I can implement it to my needs and get to coding as soon as possible as well as make my own implementations to the data structure.
